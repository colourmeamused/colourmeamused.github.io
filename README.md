# GETTING READY FOR SOUTH ISLAND (IT'S NZ BUT SOUTH)

Hello everyone,
Time flies and now it's our turn. Here are some tips, updates, and useful and useless information for your upcoming trip.

## The Boring Stuff

### Staying In Touch

We will be in Queenstown Wednesday 18th onwards and you can reach us on our phone / Whats App / iMessage.

We will set up a Whats App group for updates.

We will be staying in 2 Gum Lane, Queenstown, about 1km from the center of Queenstown (it's a small city)

### Arriving and Getting Around

If you can let us know when you will arrive, where you plan to stay, that will be great and help us coordinate.

Also can you let us know if you have rented or plan to rent a car, so we can figure out if we need to organize extra transport. It is best to have a car to get around, public transport is punctual but limited and not very flexible.

You can rent a car or get a taxi from  Queenstown airport to the city. If you are renting a car it usually makes sense to just get one from the airport.

### Food and Stuff

There's a smaller supermarket in the city, and large supermarkets and other stores near the airport in Frankton.

There's a decent variety of restaurants in and around Queenstown.

### What To Bring

The current forecast is 5-15 degrees, with a decent chance of some rain. It can get windy. Please bring warm comfortable clothes and walking shoes for Saturday, 21st, and rain gear. The plan is to make the best of any weather we run into.

## Events

We would love to have you at all the events.

### Friday, 20th April

We meet [in the park near the lake esplanade](https://goo.gl/maps/6ah1o3bjbbG2) at 5PM and set off for an evening drive and meet and greet.

### Saturday, 21st April

#### Exploring the Wilderness (0800 to 1300 starting at the Lake Esplanade)

We will leave at 8AM sharp for a trip to some stunnning spots around Queenstown and Wanaka.

#### The Ridiculous Race (1330 onwards starting at the Lake Esplanade again)

There are two ways of finding out the venues for Sunday :-)

The easy way is to message us once you reach Queenstown, take the pledge of secrecy, and get the addresses.

The fun way is to take part in The Ridiculous Race, follow the clues, and discover the answer yourself.

Let us know if you want to opt out, otherwise we will put you into one of the four teams.
