# 21st April Saturday MORNING UPDATE!

Good Morning!
The weather looks beautiful so we can stick to the plan.




## WE HAVE A PLAN?

Yes!

We are off on a day trip to [Makarora Valley](https://www.lakewanaka.co.nz/plan-your-trip/regions/makarora/) and the [Blue Pools Track](https://www.newzealand.com/int/feature/blue-pools-track/) If time permits, all the way to the Gates of Haast and Thunder Creek Falls.

On the way back, we will stop at [Wanaka](https://www.lakewanaka.co.nz/things-to-do/wanaka-food-and-drink/) and grab some lunch.


We will move the Ridiculous Race start to 2pm so we have enough time.



## BEFORE YOU START


- A more precise [meeting point](https://goo.gl/maps/8ehaAu97wKk): https://goo.gl/maps/8ehaAu97wKk
The same park, we meet at the cark park just before the roundabout.

- Please let us know if you can't make it, we will try to wait for everyone before we leave.

- If you want to opt out of the Ridiculous Race, this is your LAST CHANCE. Not really, but please let us know :-) No pressure. will involve a bit of walking / running around, depending on how badly you want to win, and chasing ridiculous clues.

- We should have at least one person with an active mobile SIM in each car. Please let Abeer/Aria know if you don't so we can shuffle.

- Download offline maps with Google Maps for the region if you haven't already. The download is under 50MB, but better to do it over WiFi before heading off.

## WHAT TO BRING

- Comfortable walking shoes
- Sunscreen, sunglasses etc.
- Mobiles, charged, especially if you have one with active roaming or a NZ sim
- Layers to wear. It's a pleasant day but it can get windy, ideally you want layers you can remove / put on quickly.
- Water and snacks, especially if you have dietary preferences. We will load up with water and Fergbakery.


# GETTING READY FOR SOUTH ISLAND (IT'S NZ BUT SOUTH)

Hello everyone,
Time flies and now it's our turn. Here are some tips, updates, and useful and useless information for your upcoming trip.

## The Boring Stuff

### Staying In Touch

We will be in Queenstown Wednesday 18th onwards and you can reach us on our phone / Whats App / iMessage.

We will set up a Whats App group for updates.

We will be staying in 2 Gum Lane, Queenstown, about 1km from the center of Queenstown (it's a small city)

**Abeer      +61497643994**

**Aria (Thu) +61423216574**

### Arriving and Getting Around

<div id="metservice-widget">
<script>
(function(d){
var i = d.createElement("iframe");
i.setAttribute("src", "https://services.metservice.com/weather-widget/widget?params=blue|large|portrait|days-3|modern&loc=queenstown&type=urban&domain=" + d.location.hostname);
i.style.width = "300px";
i.style.height = "239px";
i.style.border = "0";
i.setAttribute("allowtransparency", "true");
i.setAttribute("id", "widget-iframe");
d.getElementById("metservice-widget").appendChild(i);
})(document);
</script>
</div>


If you can let us know when you will arrive, where you plan to stay, that will be great and help us coordinate.

Also can you let us know if you have rented or plan to rent a car, so we can figure out if we need to organize extra transport. It is best to have a car to get around, public transport is punctual but limited and not very flexible.

You can rent a car or get a taxi from  Queenstown airport to the city. If you are renting a car it usually makes sense to just get one from the airport.

### Food and Stuff

There's a smaller supermarket in the city, and large supermarkets and other stores near the airport in Frankton.

There's a decent variety of restaurants in and around Queenstown.

### What To Bring

The current forecast is 5-15 degrees, with a decent chance of some rain. It can get windy. Please bring warm comfortable clothes and walking shoes for Saturday, 21st, and rain gear. The plan is to make the best of any weather we run into.

### What Not to Bring

Wedding gifts. Your presence is the best gift we can hope to receive.

## Events

We would love to have you at all the events. But if there are some events that you can't make, please let us know.

### Friday, 20th April

We meet [in the park near Lake Esplanade](https://goo.gl/maps/6ah1o3bjbbG2) at 5PM and set off for an evening drive and meet and greet.

### Saturday, 21st April

#### Exploring the Wilderness (0800 to 1300 starting at the Lake Esplanade)

We will leave at 8AM sharp for a trip to some stunnning spots around Queenstown and Wanaka.

#### The Ridiculous Race (1330 onwards starting at the Lake Esplanade again)

There are two ways of finding out the venues for Sunday :-)

The easy way is to message us once you reach Queenstown, take the pledge of secrecy, and get the addresses.

The fun way is to take part in The Ridiculous Race, follow the clues, and discover the answer yourself.

Let us know if you want to opt out, otherwise we will put you into one of the four teams.

### Sunday, 22nd April

#### Morning Ceremony (11:00 at Secret Location #1)


#### Reception (13:00 onwards at Secret Location #2)


#### Evening Gathering (7:30PM till late at 2 Gum Lane, Queenstown)
